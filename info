This is for the first lab for CSCB07. Due Sunday September 22, 2024

Lab 2 assumptions that the TA told me to make:
- To make the polynomial originally, the imput will be 2 arrays of the same length, one with coeficients and other with exponents
- Coeficients can not be 0
- Exponents can not repeat
- x can be written as x1
- if file doesnt exist, crate one. If it does, overwrite
